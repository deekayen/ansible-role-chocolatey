Install the Chocolatey package manager on Microsoft Windows.

If Chocolatey is missing from the system, the win_chocolatey module is supposed to install it. This role may be helpful to ensure Chocolatey is available on a system, even if you don't run win_chocolatey tasks against it. See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/win_chocolatey_module.html.

Role Variables
--------------

The tasks look for `choco.exe` at the `chocolatey_path`. The installer Powershell script defaults to downloading from chocolatey.org; change `chocolatey_installer` if your target machine doesn't have Internet access or uses a customized install script.

    chocolatey_installer: https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1
    chocolatey_path: c:/ProgramData/chocolatey
    chocolatey_version: latest
    chocolatey_windows_compression: "false"
